# Dali #  


## Summary ##  
Dali is a pure Golang library built on [lorca](http://github.com/zserge/lorca) in order to provide Go developers a way to create GUI-based applications using idiomatic Go.

Lorca provides a minimal binding between Go and Chrome via the Chrome Developer API.  The output of Dali is a Chrome application.  

The goal is remove the need for Go developers to embed HTML or Javascript within their applications.  Dali produces the HTML, passes it to Lorca, which serves up the application.
