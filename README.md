# An Example of Go Application with a GUI Using lorca 

I have looked all over the Googlesphere for a good example of a Go application 
that uses `github.com/zserge/lorca`.  Especially an application that leverages 
HTML5's `canvas` object.

This example creates an application that illustrates:
	* HTML 5 `canvas` drawing  
	* Buttons and lorca's function binding  
	* Golang event loop using SELECT over multiple channels
